# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Truth Check browser extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (required for extension toolbar)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (used in various contexts)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (used in extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (used in Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Requirements

- Format: PNG with transparency
- Design: Simple, recognizable icon representing fact-checking/verification
- Colors: Should work well on light and dark themes
- Style: Clean, modern design that scales well

## Placeholder Icons

For development purposes, you can use simple colored squares or download free fact-checking icons from:
- Flaticon
- Icons8
- Material Design Icons
- Feather Icons

The manifest.json references these icons, so they must exist for the extension to load properly.
